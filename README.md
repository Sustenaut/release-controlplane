# release-controlplane

The software that runs the release control plane. The roles of each repository
live in the state repositories, `Sustenaut/release-state` and
`schryer/release-state`; board snapshots live in storage. See the
[design](https://claude.ai/artifact/KGAd5vKckHCWbrKQCKMhSV).

## What runs

- **`hourly-board.yml`**, each hour for each owner: reads its `state.json` with the
  reader app, grades what it puts on the board with `pubkit board`, and keeps
  `board.json` in the storage tenant `release-<owner>` if a fact or a grade changed
  (`scripts/publish-board.py`), moving the `board` head. This repository is public
  and a state file may name private repositories, so this workflow's logs print no
  repository's name and it uploads no artifact.
- **`fleet-nightly.yml`**, each night for each owner: pubkit's reusable nightly on
  what its `state.json` governs. It needs the nightly app's `NIGHTLY_APP_ID` variable
  and `NIGHTLY_APP_KEY` secret, and the secrets `SUSTENAUT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and
  `SLACK_DM_USER_ID`, here.

## The reader app's values

This repository's `pubkit.json` names the reader app's three values in Bitwarden
and on GitHub, in its `github_app` block. `pubkit app-secrets` sends them here:

```sh
./with-secrets ./pubkit app-secrets --check   # checks only, sends nothing
./with-secrets ./pubkit app-secrets
```

`./with-secrets` reads the `Sustenaut` Bitwarden Secrets Manager project. It needs
that project's read-only machine token, as `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN` or a line in this
checkout's gitignored `.env`.
